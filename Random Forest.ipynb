    "Random Forst (RF) works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a dataset $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, RF selects randomly some features (i.e. `n_features`) from the dataset (where `n_features << d`). It also selects a random subset of the data (with `n_samples` data-points). Then, it builds a Decision Tree from those selected features and samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repeats this process `n_trees` times so that you have a number of `n_trees` Decision Trees built from different random combinations of features and different random subsets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To predict, RF takes each of the `n_trees` built Decision Trees and predict the outputs (classes); then it calculates the votes for each predicted class-label and takes the mode (most frequent label). In other words, considers the high voted predicted label as the final prediction from the random forest algorithm.\n",

    "The code below will load a training dataset into variables `X` and `y` as usual."
